      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
       The 2D Maze Game is an interactive puzzle game where players navigate a character through a labyrinth to reach the exit. 
       The game challenges players’ problem-solving and spatial reasoning skills while providing an engaging and visually appealing experience. 
       Players encounter obstacles, dead ends, and sometimes collectible items that make the maze more dynamic and fun.
